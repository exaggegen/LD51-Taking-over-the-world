About:
Made for 51th ludum dare compo by exaggegen 

General:
You appear on the islands. There are 4 enemy teams around you. Resources generates at random positions
Your goal is to destroy the fortress of each of the four teams in order to win.

If you are interested in trying to figure everything out without instructions, you can only read from the game control

How to play:
You can mine any resource
The extraction of the item is carried out by going to the resource, pressing the spacebar in the desired direction, as well as returning to the fortress and pressing the spacebar again. 
Do not forget that the player has the opportunity to extract a resource every 10 seconds, after all, you are not a professional in this. 
a unit's team is displayed as team color in a certain part of it (for example: troops have team color boots, hunters have team color stripes on their bodies, etc.)
new allies and enemies are also generated every 10 seconds, if their number does not exceed the maximum
You can mine resources with your team to get upgrades.
the fortress concentrates the team around itself. By destroying the old fortress and buying a new one, you force the team to gradually move to another point
You can also buy a troop generation building next to enemy bases
But you cannot inflict damage on the enemy, because you are a kind person, and you have no experience in this, do you?
When the enemy fortress is destroyed, he can no longer buy new buildings
Your goal will be to win through the efforts of your allies.

Get ready. Can you take over the world?
